spoiler detector:

Based on your preferences, spoiler tag an item on a page!

detects if somethin is a spoiler:
Minimum:
NLP model - straighforward
algorithms - gotta think more
Add on:
Image detector

Way it works:

1) I'll give a bare minimum, you atleast satisfy it and preferably add in more
    - Topic name,
    - abbrievations, alternate name
    - Specific episode no./title/chapter no

(text only)
Easiest to toughest to tackle:
1) Any in 1) above
2) NLP/regex/linguistic pattern detector that detects things close to 1
3) Barely any thing to do with 1, similarities that are hardd to tell if they belong to things in 1)
4) No correlation, random ass shit that somehow spoils you - images(images about a chapter or text in images)
